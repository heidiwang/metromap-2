      <h2> What is Metromaps: </h2>
      MetroMaps is a new way to discover data.
      Whether it is an overview of the News, search for legal cases, Knowledge Management in companies... MetroMaps can help get a great overview of data. 
      It automatically detects events and storylines. 


      <h2> Academic description: </h2>
      When information is abundant, it becomes increasingly dif-
      ﬁcult to ﬁt nuggets of knowledge into a single coherent pic-
      ture. Complex stories spaghetti into branches, side stories,
      and intertwining narratives. In order to explore these sto-
      ries, one needs a map to navigate unfamiliar territory. We
      propose a methodology for creating structured summaries
      of information, which we call metro maps. Our proposed
      algorithm generates a concise structured set of documents
      maximizing coverage of salient pieces of information. Most
      importantly, metro maps explicitly show the relations among
      retrieved pieces in a way that captures story development.
      We ﬁrst formalize characteristics of good maps and formu-
      late their construction as an optimization problem. Then
      we provide eﬃcient methods with theoretical guarantees for
      generating maps. Finally, we integrate user interaction into
      our framework, allowing users to alter the maps to better
      reﬂect their interests. Pilot user studies with a real-world
      dataset demonstrate that the method is able to produce
      maps which help users acquire knowledge eﬃciently.
